# Chapter 1

Three concerns that are important in software systems:

<li> Reliability

The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in face of hardware or software faults, and human error.

<li> Scalability

As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be resonable ways of dealing with that growth.

<li> Maintainability

The system should be worked on by many different people productively.
